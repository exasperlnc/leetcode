## This Repository is where I keep my leetcode practice

### min_cost_to_connect_all_points

My initial thoughts were to attempt using DP, which was a fun exercise. Through some reading I went with a solution called union find. I'm going to revisit this solution tommorrow(09/16/23), and see how much of this I can replicate, and how quickly. 

### valid_anagram

My original solution was to sort the strings and then compare them, but the ruby Enumerable#tally provides a more elegant solution.
